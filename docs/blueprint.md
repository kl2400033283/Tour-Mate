## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft, muted blue (#A0C4FF) to create a calming and professional atmosphere, without being overbearing. This hue has a friendlier look than standard blues, while avoiding looking too childish.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF), a heavily desaturated version of the primary, which gives a clean, spacious feel, suitable for creative work.
- Accent color: Lavender (#BDB2FF), slightly to the 'left' of the primary color in hue, it provides a delicate contrast for interactive elements and highlights.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (geometric sans-serif) for headlines, paired with 'PT Sans' (humanist sans-serif) for body text, for a balance of modern precision and readability.
- Simple, modern icons from a consistent set, using a line style with rounded corners for a friendly appearance.
- Clean and spacious layout with ample white space to focus attention on the design canvas.
- Subtle animations and transitions for a smooth and engaging user experience.
