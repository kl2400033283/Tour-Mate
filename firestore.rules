/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset provides a public, read-only interface for browsing cities and homestays, while also securing user-specific data. The primary goal is to allow any user to view public data, but restrict writes and user profile access to authenticated owners.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized into three independent, top-level collections:
 *   - /cities/{cityId}: Publicly readable city information.
 *   - /homestays/{homestayId}: Publicly readable homestay listings.
 *   - /users/{userId}: Private user profile data, accessible only by the owner.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read Access: `/cities` and `/homestays` are public for read operations (`get`, `list`).
 * - User-Owned Profiles: In the `/users` collection, users can only create, read, and update their own document, identified by their UID. This is enforced using the `isOwner` function.
 * - All Other Writes Disabled: Public collections are read-only. Users cannot delete their profiles or list other users.
